-A heap is a complete Binary Tree

-All levels are completely filled except the last level
-At the last level, nodes could be filled from the left side

Complete Binary Tree:

                1
               / \
             2     3
            / \   / \
           4   5 6   7
         / \  
        8   9 


Even though all levels except the last level are completely filled , this is not a complete
Binary tree since the nodes at the last level have not been filled from the left side

Types of Heaps:

1) Max heap:

-CBT
-Parent node val should be >= child node val
-root node val = max node val

               30
              /   \
             9    20
            / \   / \
           8   3 16  12
         /  \  
        5    4 

2) Min Heap:

-CBT
-Parent Node val should be <= child node val
-root node val = min node val

These properties should hold for every node in the heap


->Build Max Heap

1)Find the node where the new node will be inserted
2)Maintain the heap property

parent index i
Left child =  2*i+1
Right child = 2*i+2

Child index = i
Parent = (i-1)/2
