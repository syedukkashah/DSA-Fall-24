BT structure after inserting 1,2,3,4,5,10,50

   4     5   10   50  


we can nodes in a BT using queue
1) add root node first 1
2) add left then right child 1 2 3
3) if both children of root node are present then dequeue 2 3
4) traverse root node (front node of queue which is currently 2) and repeat 2) then 3)  3 4 5

queue visualization after 4)
  3 4 5 10 -> 4 5 10 -> 5 10 -> 5 10 50 -> 10 50 -> 50 -> queue empty
