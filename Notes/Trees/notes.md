A tree is a non linear data structure that stimulates a hierarchal tree structure with a root value
& sub trees of children w/ parent node, represented as set of linked nodes.

-Root is a special node in a tree, entire tree is referenced through it


-Parent Node = immediate predecessor of a node


-Child Node = immediate successors of a node
-Siblings = Nodes w/ same parent
-Leaf = Last node in tree
-Edge = connection b/w nodes
-Path = num of successive edges from source node -> destination node

#Tree Properties
-recursive data structure (# of nodes = n)
-edges/links = n-1
-depth of node = # of edges from root to itself
-height of node = #of edges on the longest path b/w that node & a leaf
-height of tree = height of it's root node
